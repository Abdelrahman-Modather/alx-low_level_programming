I'm like a new edition
I got fed up with my other version
Ooo let the tables turn high
Let the mothers and the fathers get by
I'm on a new direction
Gonna work it in another nation
Ooo show me how you get by
Do you swing, do you often get high
Run like a pink flamingo
You're familiar with some prison lingo
Tell all your friends about it
Now you know this is the time to ride it
Fool, i was there before you
I'm in a position to ignore you
I'm on a new direction
Gonna work it in another nation
